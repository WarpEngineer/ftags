Thinking of different options for locating tags:

realpath ()
{
    f=$@;
    if [ -d "$f" ]; then
        base="";
        dir="$f";
    else
        base="/$(basename "$f")";
        dir=$(dirname "$f");
    fi;
    dir=$(cd "$dir" && /bin/pwd);
    echo "$dir$base"
}

Option 1: mlocate
pros: 
	tags are automatically indexed
	finding tags is easy and fast
	moving a directory moves the tags too
cons:
	must have slocate installed
	must use sudo to update the db immediately
	newly added tags are not searchable until updatedb runs
Note:
	locate/slocate vs mlocate: GNU locate does not require root privileges
	to work since it can run as a regular user, however, I've noticed
	that mlocate is more likely to be found in different distributions than GNU locate. 
	Furthermore, it looks like the version installed with Mac OS requires
	root privileges too.

Option 2: find with central, hierarchical, database
pros:
	all tags are located together
cons:
	find is slower than slocate

Option 3: find with central database in single directory
pros:
	finding tags is faster since they're all together
cons:
	directory can get too big with all tag files in it
