Thinking of different options for locating tags:

Option 1: slocate
pros: 
	tags are automatically indexed
	finding tags is easy and fast
	moving a directory moves the tags too
cons:
	must have slocate installed
	must use sudo to update the db immediately
	newly added tags are not searchable until updatedb runs

Option 2: find with central, hierarchical, database
pros:
	all tags are located together
cons:
	find is slower than slocate

Option 3: find with central database in single directory
pros:
	finding tags is faster since they're all together
cons:
	directory can get too big with all tag files in it
